            <h3>About PDRF</h3>
            <p>
                The Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) is the Philippines’ major private sector vehicle and coordinator for disaster resilience. As an alliance of businesses dedicated to building the disaster management capabilities of the private sector in the country, it works on all areas: prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, and rehabilitation and recovery.
            </p>
            <h3>Brief History</h3>
                <p>
                Following the devastation caused by Typhoons Frank (Fengshen), Pepeng (Parma), and Ondoy (Kensana), the Office of the President issued E.O. No. 838 to create the Special National Public Reconstruction Commission (Public Commission), mandated to spearhead effective reconstruction measures that address the needs of disaster-stricken communities. The Public Commission then tapped the private sector to channel more support for its reconstruction programs. Thus, in 2009, leaders of the country’s largest private corporations and non-government organizations established the Philippine Disaster Recovery Foundation (PDRF).
                <br><br>
                In the same year, the two entities drew a cooperation agreement, further solidifying the commitment of the private sector to the reconstruction programs of the Philippine government.    
                </p>
            <h3>Why you should join this advocacy</h3>
            <p>
                The Philippines is very prone to disasters, because we are in the Pacific ring of fire, we suffer from more earthquakes and volcanic eruptions than the other parts of the world, aside from that we also suffer from, on average, 16 typhoons every year, so please choose this advocacy to help those affected, and to reduce the damages done.
